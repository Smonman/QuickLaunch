# QuickLaunch WIP

This small task tray programm will let you add shortcuts to open selected programs on the fly.

##Usage
After starting the program, a task tray icon will appear. Right clicking this icon will display a context menu with different options.
To add program shortcuts select `config`.

Note: No semicolons, line breaks or tabs are allowed in the title of a shortcut.

The shortcuts will be saved under `%AppData%/Local/QuickLaunch/items.txt`. This file might be deleted, after deinstalling this program.
